Fluid Boundary Conditions
-------------------------


T-infinity defines the following boundary conditions:
    - Farfield
    - No-Slip Wall:

      - Constant Temperature
      - Specified Temperature T(x,y,z)
      - Adiabatic

    - Tangent Slip
    - Cartesian Plane Symmetry (x, y, z)
    - Arbitrary Plane Symmetry
    - Supersonic Outflow
    - Subsonic Outflow
    - Supersonic Inflow
    - Subsonic Inflow
    - Forced Overset Interpolation
